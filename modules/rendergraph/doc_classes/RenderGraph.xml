	<description>
		The RenderGraph resource allows you to visually design a rendering pipeline.
		It is a collection of nodes that represent rendering operations, such as rendering a mesh, rendering a shadow map, or post-processing effects.	
		The nodes are connected by edges, which represent the flow of data between the nodes.
		The nodes can be connected in any way, allowing you to create complex rendering pipelines.
